# Sync in JS

- Synchronous.

  - Synchronous means the code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in the program.
  - Each instruction waits for the previous instruction to complete its execution.

- Asynchronous.
  - Due to synchronous programming, sometimes imp instructions get blocked due to some previous instructions, which causes a delay in the UI.
  - Asynchronous code execution allows to execute next instructions immediately and doesn't block the flow.

# Callbacks

- A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function.

# Callback Hell

- Callback Hell : Nested callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid structure. (Pyramid of Doom)
- This style of programming becomes difficult to understand & manage.
